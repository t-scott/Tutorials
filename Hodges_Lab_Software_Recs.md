# Hey! 
This page is simply a list of what software we like for text editting and interacting with the command line. 


# Text editors
## Sublime Text
- Several of us use Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
  - Benefits:
    - It's light weight
    - I've never had a formatting issue between copying/pasting code from this program to the terminal or anything else (some have weird newline/spacing issues)
    - You can split screen easily, among many other customizations
    - It can handle really large files with relative ease, and can also handle multiple large files without killing your computer's memory
  - Downfall:
    - It's "free to use." You can run through the "free trial" and continue to use it cost-free, though you will have to click through the pop-up for upgrading when closing it
   
## BBEdit
- Some of us also use BBEdit: https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/
  - Benefits:
    - This program has been around for 30+ years and has grown more powerful over time
    - It has a very, very good tab system to keep track of files and directories, which is nice!
    -   

## Atom
- This one is cool, too. 
  - Benefits: 
    - Also a modern, well-used program that comes well-recommended
    - Very customizable as the rest
  - Downfalls:
    - Members of the lab have used this but have since had trouble installing. If you can install, then this comes recommended as well.  

# Terminal
## Terminal
- This is fine and will fulfill all your realistic needs

## iTerm2
- TS: I used to think this one sucked and didn't understand why it was recommended
- This is very, very similar to Terminal for major day-to-day uses
  - This is however, gives you things like split-screen, searchability, easier copy/paste, support for notification for process completion, among others
    - Again, besides split-sreen and sometimes search, I really don't notice a huge difference (TS)
