# Hey! 
This page is simply a list of what software we like for text editting and interacting with the command line. 

The major things for Sublime and BBEdit are their speed and ability to open very large files, which is a common need in genetics. 


# Text editors
## Sublime Text
- Several of us use Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
  - Benefits:
    - It's lightweight and is extremely fast
    - I've never had a formatting issue between copying/pasting code from this program to the terminal or anything else (some have weird newline/spacing issues)
    - You can split screen easily, among many other customizations
    - It can handle really large files with relative ease, and can also handle multiple large files without killing your computer's memory
  - Downfall:
    - It's "free to use." You can run through the "free trial" and continue to use it cost-free, though you will have to click through the pop-up for upgrading when closing the program.
   
## BBEdit
- Some of us also use BBEdit: https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/
  - Benefits:
    - This program has been around for 30+ years and has grown more powerful over time
    - It has a very, very good tab system to keep track of files and directories, which is nice!
    - It can also auto-detect the programming language for nice, colorful code formatting.
    - It also now has a "minimap" for quickly finding your spot in a long script. 

## Atom
- This one is cool, too. 
  - Benefits: 
    - Also a modern, well-used program that comes well-recommended
    - Very customizable as the rest
  - Downfalls:
    - Members of the lab have used this but have since had trouble installing. If you can install, then this comes recommended as well.  

# Terminal
## Terminal
- This is fine and will fulfill all your realistic needs

## iTerm2
- TS: I used to think this one was not great and didn't understand why it was recommended
  - Now, this is the one I use and I really enjoy it 
- This is very, very similar to Terminal for major day-to-day uses
  - This is however, gives you things like split-screen, searchability, easier copy/paste, support for notification for process completion, among others
    - Again, besides split-sreen and sometimes search, I really don't notice a huge difference (TS)
