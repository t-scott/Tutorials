# Basic idea:
This (hopefully) describes how to iterate over a list of files and ggplot them, assuming you want to apply the same ggplot function to each file
Example usage:  
- I have a directory of 1000 PheWAS output results that I'd like to plot, and their rsIDs are part of the output file names: rs12345.output.txt, rs23456.output.txt, rs34567.output.txt, ...
